<h1>About this project</h1>
<br>
<p>This Tic-Tac-Toe project was built as part of my JavaScript learning journey while following the Apna College course.
  It is a simple yet interactive game designed purely for practice, helping me understand core JavaScript concepts
  like DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic. While this project is not meant for production use,
  it serves as a foundational step in my web development journey. Feel free to explore the code, experiment,
  and improve upon it!</p>
